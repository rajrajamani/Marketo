This is a version of the GoogleConversionTracker service that Marketo is 
hosting.  We are making this available to you so that you can host it 
yourself.  

HOW IT WORKS
============
This service listens for inbound webhook calls from Marketo.  It parses
the info sent by Webhook and appends it to a file.  The files get rolled
over every sunday (at midnight).  

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
===================
1. Download and install Java 5 (or higher) 
2. Download and Install Play framework 1.2.5.  You can get the package 
from http://downloads.typesafe.com/releases/play-1.2.5.zip.  Instructions
to install are at http://www.playframework.com/documentation/1.2.5/install
3. Download the GoogleConversionTracker project from github 
https://github.com/rajrajamani/MarketoSamples/tree/master/GoogleConversionTracker
4. Edit the following settings in 
GoogleConversionTracker/conf/application.conf
   a. mkto.serviceUrl should point to your server where this
   service will run
   b. Change the timezone info in mkto.googFileHeader.  Default
   is set to -0800 (pacific time) 
5. Start the application -
	cd GoogleConversionTracker
	play start
6. Navigate to the server url from your browser.  Default port is 9000.  When 
running on my localhost, the address is http://localhost:9000.  You should 
see a page titled "Marketo Campaign Service" which prompts you for your 
Munchkin account id
7. Configure webhooks to send your offline conversion data to this service.
Instructions are provided in the document titled 
"Integrating Conversion Import with Marketo" 
8. Enter your munchkin account Id in the default field.  You can get your 
munchkin account id by going to Marketo Admin->Munchkin page.
9. You will see a list of CSV files for your subscription (if there are any).
When no data has been sent to this service by the webhook, you will see an
empty page
