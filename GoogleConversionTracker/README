This is a version of the GoogleConversionTracker service that Marketo is 
hosting.  We are making this available to you so that you can host it 
yourself.  

HOW IT WORKS
============
This service listens for inbound webhook calls from Marketo.  It parses
the info sent by Webhook and appends it to a file.  The files get rolled
over every sunday (at midnight).

===================
1. Download and install Java 5 (or higher) 
2. Download and Install Play framework 1.2.5.  You can get the package 
from http://downloads.typesafe.com/releases/play-1.2.5.zip.  Instructions

3. Download the GoogleConversionTracker project from github

2. Edit the following settings in
