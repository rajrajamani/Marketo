This is a version of the GoogleConversionTracker service that Marketo is 
hosting. We are making this available to you so that you can host it 
yourself.  

HOW IT WORKS
============
This service listens for inbound webhook calls from Marketo. It parses the 
info sent by the webhook and appends it to a file. The information for the 
current week is captured in a file called “latest.csv”. This file gets
 “rolled over” every Sunday at midnight Pacific Time which means it will be
  renamed to “Sunday mmm dd.csv” every Sunday night.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
===================
1. Download and install Java 5 (or higher) 
2. Download and Install Play framework 1.2.5.  You can get the package from
 http://downloads.typesafe.com/releases/play-1.2.5.zip.  Instructions to install
  are at http://www.playframework.com/documentation/1.2.5/install
3. Download the GoogleConversionTracker project from github 
https://github.com/rajrajamani/MarketoSamples/tree/master/GoogleConversionTracker
4. Edit the following settings in 
GoogleConversionTracker/conf/application.conf
   a. mkto.serviceUrl should point to your server where this service will run
   b. Change the time zone info in mkto.googFileHeader, if needed. The default is 
   set to -0800 (Pacific Time) 
5. Start the application -
	cd GoogleConversionTracker
	play start
6. Navigate to the server url from your browser.  Default port is 9000.  When 
running on my localhost, the address is http://localhost:9000. You should see a 
page titled "Marketo Campaign Service" which prompts you for your Munchkin 
Account ID.
7. Enter your Munchkin Account ID in the default field. You can get your Munchkin 
Account ID by going to Marketo Admin->Munchkin page.
8. You will see a list of CSV files for your subscription (if there are any).
When no data has been sent to this service by the webhook, you will see an 
empty page.

including how to configure webhooks to send data to this service, are
