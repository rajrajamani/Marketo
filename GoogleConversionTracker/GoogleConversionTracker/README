This is a version of the GoogleConversionTracker service that Marketo is 
hosting.  We are making this available to you so that you can host it 
yourself.  

HOW IT WORKS
============
This service listens for inbound webhook calls from Marketo.  It parses
the info sent by Webhook and appends it to a file.  The files get rolled
over every sunday (at midnight).  

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
===================
1. Install Play framework 1.2.5.  You can get the package from 
http://downloads.typesafe.com/releases/play-1.2.5.zip

2. Edit the following settings in 
GoogleConversionTracker/conf/application.conf
   a. mkto.serviceUrl should point to your server where this
   service will run

   is set to -0800 (pacific time)
